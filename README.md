## üõ† Data Collection and Preparation

The following steps were performed to collect and prepare the data:

| Step | Action                          | Description                                                                              |
| ---- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | **Browser Setup**               | Installed and initialized Firefox browser via Selenium and GeckoDriver Manager.          |
| 2    | **Cookie Handling**             | Automated acceptance of cookie banners on YouGov pages.                                  |
| 3    | **Top Organization Extraction** | Scraped top 20 organizations‚Äô names and profile URLs from ranking pages.                 |
| 4    | **Single Org Data Extraction**  | Extracted detailed metrics (`Fame`, `Popularity`, `Disliked by`, `Neutral`) for one org. |
| 5    | **Full Dataset Extraction**     | Iterated over all organizations to collect both URLs and statistics programmatically.    |
| 6    | **Data Storage**                | Saved the final dataset as `charity_organizations.json` for future analysis.             |
| 7    | **Data Validation**             | Reopened the JSON file to verify completeness and correctness of the stored data.        |
